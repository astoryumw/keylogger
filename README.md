# Keylogger
Keylogger.py program takes all information entered by user and saves the plain text version in log.txt, though this can be commented out as need be.
The program also encrypts the entered information in encryptedLog.txt and saves the decryption key in key.key.
Afterwards, the encrypted file can be decrypted using decrypt.py alongside the key. 
The key and encrypted file are emailed out to user email account.
